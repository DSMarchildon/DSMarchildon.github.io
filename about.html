<h1>Dan Marchildon</h1>
<p>As a technical communication major from <a href="http://tcid.hss.kennesaw.edu/">Kennesaw State University</a>, I bridge the gap between the worlds of technology, writing, and design. My portfolio expands this bridge by showcasing the technical and visual aspects of my craft. I work on graphic design, which creates a visual representation that better demonstrates concepts for users. My writing helps users better understand technical terms, including those used in technological fields.</p>
  <p>I also use communication through creative means, such as writing. My <a href="http://dsmarchildon.me/portfolio.html">portfolio</a> showcases my projects, both technical and creative, and demonstrates my ability to communicate through different mediums.</p>

  <p>Here is a list of the skills and proficiencies I possess as a technical communicator, designer, and writer:</p>
  
  <p>
•	Technical and Creative writing
  </p>
  <p>
•	Editing
</p>
  <p>
•	Graphic design
  </p>
  <p>
•	Photoshop
</p>
  <p>
•	Office Suite
</p>
  <p>
•	Sony Vegas
</p>
  
<p>Outside of my professional hobbies, I enjoy reading, drawing, writing, watching movies, hiking, and spending time with my family.</p>
