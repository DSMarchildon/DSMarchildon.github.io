<h1>This is my About page</h1>
<p>As a technical communicator, I bridge the gap between the worlds of technology, writing, and design. My portfolio expands this bridge by showcasing the technical and visual aspects of my craft. I work on graphic design, which creates a visual representation that better demonstrates concepts for users. My writing helps users better understand technical terms, including those used in engineering and computer science. </p>
