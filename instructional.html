  <h1>Instructional Design</h1>
      <p>Instructional design is the process of creating learning experiences and products that are designed to help develop and deliver knowledge. These products include things such as online courses, instructional manuals, and even video tutorials. </p>

        <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1294786" target="_blank"><img src="Canvas_Pic.PNG" alt="Instructional online course on Worldbuilding." border="2" width="300" height="300"></a>
        <p>Above is a link to my Canvas online course.</p>
        <h3>Purpose:</h3>
        <p>Canvas is an online learning module system perfectly fitted to create instructional courses. In my instructional design class, we were tasked with creating an online course of our own. I chose to work with a more creative subject, worldbuilding and how to do it.</p>
        <p>The purpose for the course project was to implement and showcase various instructional design elements and strategies within the online course.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Skills:</h3>
        <p>The skills needed to create an instructional design oriented course are both visual and textual. The layout and design of the course is important in order to foster an environment where learning is accessible and the user can achieve and attain a level of knowledge. The actual way the course is written and presented in text is also important.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <p>This project helped me develop an appreciation in what goes into creating instructions. Instructional design is not only important for technical writing of instruction manuals and the like, but it’s paramount for learning experiences where knowledge is gained.</p>
