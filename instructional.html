  <h1>Instructional Design</h1>
      <p>Instructional design is the process of creating learning experiences and products that are designed to help develop and deliver knowledge. These products include things such as online courses, instructional manuals, and even video tutorials. </p>

     <h2>CanvasLMS - Intro to Worldbuilding Online Course</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1294786" target="_blank"><img src="Canvas_Pic.PNG" alt="Instructional online course on Worldbuilding." border="2" width="300" height="300"></a>
        <p>Above is a link to my Canvas online course.</p>
        <h3>Purpose:</h3>
        <p>Canvas is an online learning module system perfectly fitted to create instructional courses. In my instructional design class, we were tasked with creating an online course of our own. I chose to work with a more creative subject, worldbuilding and how to do it.</p>
        <p>The purpose for the course project was to implement and showcase various instructional design elements and strategies within the online course.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Skills:</h3>
        <p>The skills needed to create an instructional design oriented course are both visual and textual. The layout and design of the course is important in order to foster an environment where learning is accessible and the user can achieve and attain a level of knowledge. The actual way the course is written and presented in text is also important.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <p>This project helped me develop an appreciation in what goes into creating instructions. Instructional design is not only important for technical writing of instruction manuals and the like, but it’s paramount for learning experiences where knowledge is gained.</p>

        <h2>QDOS Baby Proofing Latch Instructional Video</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <a href="https://streamable.com/omekt" target="_blank"><img src="Qdos_Baby_Latch_Pic.png" alt="." border="2" width="500" height="300"></a>
        <p>Above is a link to the Baby Proofing Latch video.</p>
        <h3>Purpose:</h3>
        <p>In my instructional design course, we were tasked with redesigning and creating a new instructional supplement for QDOS’ Baby Proofing Latch. We were given the actual product to work with and test out. When we finished and submitted our project, the company would choose the one design that they liked.</p>

<p>I chose to make a video installation tutorial using footage from their previously released video. I edited together a more whimsical and narrated approach, which I thought would engage the audience with the video more.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Skills:</h3>
        <p>The main skill needed for creating the installation tutorial video was video editing. I had to translate the written manual into audio instructions for the video. I enjoy creating and editing videos with Sony Vegas Pro, so it wasn’t too hard to get the ball rolling. I have a creative knack for making videos and it’s something that I enjoy doing in my spare time and hopefully on a professional level someday.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <p>Creating the video for QDOS was rewarding for myself and a great experience. The project acted like a professional employer asking you personally to create an instructional piece for a company.</p>

<p>In the end, QDOS chose my installation video as the best among the other designs and said they would be taking inspiration from it into their own marketing moving forward.</p>
