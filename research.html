  <h1>Writing and Research</h1>
      <p>This section of my portfolio details group projects that were created for Usability Testing. Usability Testing is a process where users are interviewed and tested on a product's ease of use and accessibility. A lot of preliminary and process work goes into creating personas and scenarios, setting up the test and task goals, and ultimately creating a final report that analyzes and discusses the findings. </p>
    <h3>GroupMe GORT Bot</h3>

        <a href="Johnson_Marchildon_McGinnis_Meigs_Williams-0102-Usability_Report.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="GORT_Bot_Pic.PNG" alt="An IMRAD report from my Usability Testing group project." width="300" height="300"></a>
        <p>Above is a PDF link to the IMRAD report of the GORT Bot. </p>
        <h3>Purpose:</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to test the functionality and accessibility of a GroupMe bot named GORTBOT. My project team interviewed and tested several users on a determined list of GORTBOT functions to see what potential users face when using the bot. The end result was an IMRAD report that we wrote to the GORTBORT team that analyzed and discussed possible ways the bot, and its documentation, could be improved－and made more user-centered.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Skills:</h3>
        <p>The skills required to create a purposeful and reflective report document were mainly technical writing and editing. We had to translate the video footage of our users being tested into a textual context for the report－which included several informative graphs.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Soft Skills:</h3>
        <p>Since the testing and interviews were recorded, a lot of communication soft skills were needed to effectively obtain results from the users. A moderator script had to be created that took into consideration things such as tone and voice. If the user, during the testing, did not feel comfortable at any time, then that would have been a problem. Our team did a good job with maintaining a professional level during the testing. We also had to present our findings to the potential employer.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Roles:</h3>
    <p>The project members were myself, Phoebe Williams, Tyler McGinnis, Sam Meigs, and Desmond Johnson.</p>
        <p>My main role during the interview and testing process was to observe the user and notate their actions and words. This documentation was used later on in creating the IMRAD report. I wrote several sections of the report, including the user step list, stories of user scenarios when they ran into a problem, and the discussion section which came up with solutions to the problems we observed with the GORTBOT.</p>
        <p>I also edited the video footage of the users into a usable montage that we showed during our presentation－which also included a blooper reel.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <p>The project as a whole gave me great insight into working with a team and having responsibility for my part. It showed me how to deal with and help users in a testing environment. The entire usability process was fascinating to me.</p>
