  <h1>Technical Writing</h1>
      <p>Technical writing is the process of documenting and translating technical information into accessible content for a specific audience. Technical writing also includes elements of data visualization and information design. The main goal of any technical writer is to connect with their intended audience.</p>

     <h2>Data Stories</h2>

        <h3>Purpose:</h3>
        <p>The purpose of a data story is to take information and create a narrative in the view point of a user. How would someone visiting my portfolio site initially react? What would they look for? Data stories are a great way to get into the minds of your audience in order to benefit and improve as a whole.</p>

<p>This data storyâ€™s narrative focused on an employer looking to hire a KSU alumni to redesign their website.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Skills:</h3>
        <p>Creating a data story requires knowledge of the subject of the narrative, as well as writing skills. It is important to be able to carry a narrative through creative means, which is sometimes an undervalued skill when it comes to technical writing.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <p>Data stories can be a vital tool in connecting with your audience and its needs. Stepping into their shoes and viewing data from their perspective is valuable information. Data stories are also fun to write and can help virtually any user/consumer based product or company.</p>
