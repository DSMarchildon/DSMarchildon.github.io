  <h1>My Writings</h1>
    <h2>2016-17</h2>
      <p>This is my current writing selection which contains PDF links to stories I wrote within the same fictional setting.</p>
    <h3>Giant's Wake Setting Overview</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <a href="Giants_Wake_PDF.pdf"><img src="Giants_Wake_Image.JPG" alt="An overview and history of the setting I created for a Worldbuilding class at KSU." width="300" height="300"></a>
        <p>This is an overview of a setting I created for a Worldbuilding class. </p>
        <p>I was assigned with a course-wide project that encompassed the entire semester; create a world from nothing. The class was based around modules where we would learn about various topics on a weekly basis. Topics like mapmaking, general story narrative, history building, and even languages. Giant's Wake is the final product that I produced at the end of the semester.</p>
        <br>
    <h3>The Last Throne</h3>
      <a href="The_Last_Throne_PDF.pdf"><img src="The_Last_Throne_Image.JPG" alt="The final draft of a short story I created within my Giant's Wake setting." height="300" width="300"></a>
      <p>This is a short story I created that is a part of my Giant's Wake setting that I created for my Worldbuilding class.</p>
      <p>The short story details the life of a Dwarven stonesmith that is tasked with carving out a dead King's last throne.</p>
