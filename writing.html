  <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>2016-17</h2>
      <p>This is my current portfolio which contains mainly school projects, advertisement redesigns, and essays/writings.</p>
    <h3>Consumer Freedom Ad Redesign</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <a href="Redesigned_Consumer_Freedom_Ad_Marchildon.jpg"><img src="Redesigned_Consumer_Freedom_Ad_Marchildon.jpg" alt="A Redesigned Consumer Freedom Ad About Soda Taxes that were proposed in New York City" width="300" height="300"></a>
        <p>This is a <a href="https://www.consumerfreedom.com/">Consumer Freedom</a> advertisement I redesigned for my <a href="http://catalog.kennesaw.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=29&poid=3842&returnto=2354#">Fundamentals of Information Design</a> course.</p>
        <p>I was assigned with changing the ad's audience and refocusing the content to reflect that change. The ad is from Consumer Freedom and dealt with the "Soda Tax" issue in New York City. The original ad was abrasive and insulting in nature, so I toned down the content to be more reader and audience friendly.</p>
        <br>
    <h3>Hemophilia of Georgia Brochure Redesign</h3>
      <a href="Hemophilia_of_Georgia_Von_Willebrand_Disease_Brochure_Final.JPG"><img src="Hemophilia_of_Georgia_Von_Willebrand_Disease_Brochure_Final.JPG" alt="The final edit for the von Willebrand Disease brochure from Hemophilia of Georgia" height="300" width="300"></a>
      <p>This is a <a href="https://www.hog.org/">Hemophilia of Georgia</a> brochure redesign I did for my <a href="http://catalog.kennesaw.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=29&poid=3842&returnto=2354#">Techincal Editing</a> course.</p>
      <p>The goal was to do several level edits, including format and style edits, to create a better looking document. I took the original brochure and added in sections of important information on the history of von Willebrand's Disease and its treatment regarding women.</p>
      <br>
    <h3>Cobb Antique Mall Website Redesign</h3>
      <a href="Cobb_Antique_Mall_Home_Page_Final_Sample.jpg"><img src="Cobb_Antique_Mall_Home_Page_Final_Sample.jpg" alt="The final redesign for the Cobb Antique Mall's homepage of their website." height="300" width="300"></a>
      <p>This is a website redesign I did on the <a href="https://www.cobbantiques.com/">Cobb Antique Mall</a>. It was part of a Capstone Project I did for the final of my Fundamentals of Information Design course.</p>
      <p>The assignment was based around getting a local company to sponsor me in helping them redesign their website. The purpose was to use their guidelines and suggestions to redesign up to 4 of their webpages.
